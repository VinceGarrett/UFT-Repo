# UFT-Repo
UniFractal Theory (UFT) Repository
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the UniFractal Theory (UFT), supporting the paper "UniFractal Theory: A Comprehensive Theory of Everything" by Vincent Mark Garrett and Grok 3 (submitted May 18, 2025). This repository contains simulation code and supplementary derivations for UFT, a unified framework integrating quantum mechanics, gravitation, and cosmology through a 5D Anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk, continuous fractional dimensional partitions, scalar field dynamics, and holographic conformal field theory (CFT).
About UFT
UFT proposes a 5D bulk with a hybrid metric (AdS, de Sitter, Minkowski, warped) and a fractal fiber bundle to project physical laws onto a 4D fractal-holographic spacetime. Key features:

Emergent Spacetime: Scalar fields ((\phi, \psi)) generate time and space (Equations 13–15).
Fractal Structure: Continuous partitions ((|s| + |t| \leq 4)) yield effective dimensionality (D_{\text{eff}} \sim 2.5–4) (Equation 8).
Exotic Phenomena: Supports negative energy production (~10^77 J/m^3, Equation 16) for faster-than-light applications.
Empirical Alignment: Matches electron mass (0.00004%), CMB temperature (0.0007%), and predicts gravitational waves (LISA) and collider signatures (FCC).

See the paper for details (Section 3.8, Table 1).

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ with NumPy (pip install numpy)
LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live) for compiling derivations
Git for cloning the repository

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/UFT-Repo.git
cd UFT-Repo


Install Python dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt  # If requirements.txt is added



Running Simulations
To run the Monte Carlo simulation for fractal bundle correlations:
cd simulations
python monte_carlo_fractal.py


Output: Generates data/simulation_output.csv with Hausdorff dimension estimates (~2.5 after (10^4) iterations).
Parameters: Adjust lattice size ((10^6) points) and iterations in the script (see comments).

Viewing Derivations

Open derivations/derivations.pdf for compiled derivations.
Compile derivations/derivations.tex with pdflatex derivations.tex for the latest version.

Usage

Researchers: Use monte_carlo_fractal.py to validate fractal signatures (Hausdorff ~2.5) or extend simulations for other UFT predictions (e.g., collider signatures).
Theorists: Refer to derivations.pdf for detailed mathematics supporting the 5D bulk metric, fractal fiber bundle, and CFT mapping.
Educators: Use docs/UFT_Paper_Summary.pdf for an accessible overview of UFT.
